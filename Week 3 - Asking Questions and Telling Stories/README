Few - Chapter 3 - Thinking with Our Eyes
- Understanding and sight are very closely linked
- Eye and visual cortex of brain form a parallel processor that provides the highest-bandwith channel into human cognitive centers
- Facts about memory
  -We do not attend to everything that we see. Visual perception is seletive. Our attention is often drawn to contrasts to the norm. 
  -Our eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We see what we know and expect. 
  -Memory plays an important role in human cognition, but working memory is extremely limited
-Pre-attentive attributes
  -form (length, width, size, shape, blur)
  -color (hue, intensity)
  -spatial position (2-D Position, Spatial Grouping) 
  -motion (direction)
- Four types of objects
  - Points
  - Lines
  - Bars
  - Boxes
- Long-term memory is where information is stored permanently, available for recall whenever needed
- Working memory stores information only briefly
  - able to handle around 3 chunks of information at a time
  - information visualization can condense a group of numbers into one "chunk" of information.
